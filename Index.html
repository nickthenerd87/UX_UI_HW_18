                    <h1> Hello, Im Nickolas Michael</h1>
                    <p> Since I was a kid, I have always been somewhat of a computer nerd, I remember always being in front of the computer as a little boy. I would make Britney Spears fan pages on Angel fire in the 90s which later transitioned into making Myspace pages for friends in the 00's. I even taught myself Photoshop when it first came out!

                        <br> <br>
                        However, after High School I chose to pursue a career in the Healthcare field and went on to get my degree in Kinesiology from California State University, Fullerton. I eventually became a Hospital Account Manager for a Healthcare Telecommunications Company servicing multiple major hospitals across California. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit I was working alongside nurses on the frontlines. Like many people it was a life changing experience for me. I got to see first-hand the toll the Virus had taken on people and in life. It was then I decided I want to follow a passion and hobby I had once forgot I loved so much. I wanted to pursue a new career in web design and found UX/UI design was for me.
                        <br> <br>
                        In my experience in the healthcare field I have worked with all types of people  Patients, Engineers, Business Managers, CNO's, Nurses, & Doctors. Over time I have sharpened my ability to be empathetic towards others. This helps me be a great designer because not only  can I think on a level to service multiple types of users at once. It helps me understand other users and tell a better story through Web Design. 

                        <br> <br>
                        I recently completed my UX/UI certification program at University of California, Irvine with the hope of becoming a UX/UI Designer. I do enjoy seeing the process as a whole going from a user experience (UX) process and seeing the design completed and going through the user interface design(UI) process. I did find myself gravitating towards styling websites and giving it a personality and a voice. I believe part of being a good designer is to be able to tell a story and translate it into a web design in order to connect with people. Being able to keep them engaged in the story you want to tell through your website or app. Which is part of the reason I love the UI side so much it is your ability to create and enhance the website which truly improves the user experience.
